# Mental_Health_in_Tech
A project using machine learning and visualization to analyze the "Mental Health in Tech" dataframe from Kaggle

<strong><h1>In this project I:</h1></strong>

  * Cleaned the data to make it usable for visuzliations and machine learning algorithms.

  * Analyzed and explored the data using univariate and multivariate analysis.

  * Took the appropriate pre-processing steps for the machine learning models.

  * Used supervised machine learning to create a model that predicts whether or not an employee would be comfortable talking to their supervisor about their mental health.

  * Used unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms on the data and evaluated them using silhoutte_score.


<strong><h1>A summary of my findings:</h1></strong>

A highly accurate prediction (80%) can be made, based on the data from this dataset, as to whether or not an employee is likely to be willing to talk to their supervisor about mental health.

<strong>Based on data visualizations, a number of insights can be gleaned concerning the feelings and practices surrounding mental health for tech workers:</strong>

  * About 33% of respondents have a family history of mental health.

  * About 50% have sought treatment for mental health.

  * About 33% would not be comfortable talking to a supervisor about mental health.

  * An overwhelming majority (about 83%) would not bring up mental health in an interview and about 66% think it would or might have negative effects if they were to have a discussion about mental health with their employer.

  * Men are less likely to have gotten treatment for mental illness.

  * The vast majority of employees (1000+ in this dataset) would not mention mental illness in an interview, but many would be open to talking about it with a supervisor (600+ in this dataset).

  * Many who would not talk to a supervisor would talk to a coworker.

  * Whether or not a person feels comfortable talking to a supervisor is not correlated to whether or not they have been treated for mental illness. Although not visualized in this project, the same is true about talking to coworkers, so we can expand to say that whether a person feels comfortable talking about mental health at work is not correlated to whether or not they have been treated for mental illness.

  * Despite half of the respondents having had mental health issues serious enough for professional care, a substantial number of respondents feel uncomfortable talking about mental illness, or feel that talking about their own mental health could have negative consequences.

<strong>Some deas for improving company cultures around mental health care, aiming (1) for more employees to think their employers take mental health seriously, and (2) for companies to support those with mental health issues:</strong>

  * Employers or supervisors opening conversations about mental health care so that employees feel that the topic is safe.

  * Coworker support structures (since many who would not feel comfortable talking to a supervisor would talk to a coworker); what might this look like?

  * Companies providing wellness programs and mental health care, such as insurance coverage for counseling.

  * Advertising the company's options for mental health care (many respondents were not aware of the options).
